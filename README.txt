In this project, I attempt to create the base of a 3D graphics engine from scratch using the SDL libraries for the visuals (2D) and projection matrix to transpose the 3D space into a 2D screen representation.
I also implemented functions to read information from .obj files into triangle and vertex information for my graphics engine to use.
Performance is limited due to the drawing of the triangles, not the algorithm behind the matrix calculations. Using a lower resolution (in game) helps with performance issues.
